# 🐍 Python Banner Grabber
This is a simple Python tool that connects to a specified IP address and port to grab the service banner from that network service. 🕵️‍♂️ Service banners often reveal info about software and versions running on the remote host — useful for reconnaissance and security checks.

## 🚀 How to use:
➡️ Run the script in any Python environment 🖥️

🌍 Enter the IP address of the target device when asked

🔌 Enter the port number of the service you want to check

💬 The tool will connect and show the banner message, if available

## ⚠️ Important:
❗ Use this tool only on devices you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use can be illegal and unethical. 🚫
